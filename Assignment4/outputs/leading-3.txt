Black Friday shoppers hunt savings without the frenzy of past years. U.S. malls see brisk business but little fanfare as much selling moves online. Shoppers hunted for deals and hit the stores for entertainment Friday as U.S. malls opened for one of the busiest days of the year, even as the start of the holiday season edges ever earlier. Julie Singewald's Black Friday started at 4 a.m. at an outlet mall. By 6 a.m., she and her two teenagers made it to the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.
Singewald said she was merely the vehicle - "and sometimes the credit card" - as her daughters worked on their shopping lists.
