Google invests $4.5 Million in Montreal AI Research. "How crazy is this start to the Habs' season?!" I think we all know the answer to that question (especially if you live in Montreal! ), but in casual conversation there's a good chance this phrasing and terminology would trip up a computer trying to make sense of what's being said. Learning high-level abstractions is a major research challenge for deep learning. A new grant from Google for the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) will fund seven faculty across a number of Montreal institutions and will help tackle some of the biggest challenges in machine learning and AI, including applications in the realm of systems that can understand and generate natural language.
