Massive fire breaks out in downtown Montreal. More than 120 firefighters battled a massive five-alarm fire that broke out in a building in downtown Montreal for several hours on Wednesday. Residents were asked to evacuate the area near Park Ave., south of Milton Street, where witnesses reported large plumes of black smoke coming from the abandoned R.S.Muir building. Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre tweeted a photo on Wednesday morning of flames coming from the building and asked people to avoid the area. CTV Montreal's Annie DeMelt reported that the fire had spread to the building next door, which houses Italian restaurant Alto.
