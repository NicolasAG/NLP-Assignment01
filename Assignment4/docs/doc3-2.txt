Why Black Friday Could Be Record Breaking for Amazon.
Amazon said customers shopped at record levels on Thanksgiving.
Many retailers are rejoicing this week as consumers are spending at record levels online this Thanksgiving and Black Friday.
E-commerce giant Amazon is also capitalizing on this trend, with the company reporting that customers are shopping at record levels both on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year.
The tech giant reported Thanksgiving has now become one of the busiest mobile shopping days on Amazon.com within the U.S.
Mobile orders from Amazon AMZN 0.03% customers on Thanksgiving Day exceeded both Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday - the Monday after Thanksgiving - in 2015.
The Seattle-based corporation added Black Friday shopping on Amazon.com is already on pace to surpass Black Friday last year, in terms of items ordered.
So far, the best-selling items being sold on Amazon.com include the company's own hardware, such as home automation device Echo Dot and media streaming device Fire TV.
Other top-selling items include Hasbro's Pie Face Game and Sennheiser HD 598 headphones.
Already, Amazon customers have ordered more than 100,000 toys thus far this Black Friday.
Amazon's big win in terms of online shopping could still be ahead as the company looks to Cyber Monday, with hopes that online shoppers will continue to flock to the company's marketplace to buy holiday gifts.
Last year, customers ordered 54 million items worldwide.
This year, Amazon said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday.
Some promotions will include $40 off the Amazon Echo ($139.99), 50% off some toys, and as much as 50% off many video games.
Holiday season consumers have been spending record amounts online this year, especially on mobile phones.
But it's not just e-commerce only companies that are seeing strong levels of spending.
Target TGT 0.17% reported record online sales for Thanksgiving as did Kohls.
