Massive fire breaks out in downtown Montreal.
More than 120 firefighters battled a massive five-alarm fire that broke out in a building in downtown Montreal for several hours on Wednesday.
Residents were asked to evacuate the area near Park Ave., south of Milton Street, where witnesses reported large plumes of black smoke coming from the abandoned R.S.Muir building.
Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre tweeted a photo on Wednesday morning of flames coming from the building and asked people to avoid the area.
CTV Montreal's Annie DeMelt reported that the fire had spread to the building next door, which houses Italian restaurant Alto.
By midday it was obvious that the building could not be saved, and the only way to control the blaze was to tear the building down.
The R.S.Muir building was constructed in 1875.
The ground-floor space was vacant, and construction was taking place in the building.
Fire officials on scene said that squatters were known to hang out in the building, and that a lot of combustible materials were inside at the time the fire broke out.

Firefighters said they are doing their best to try to limit damage to the restaurant.
There was no immediate word on the cause of the fire, or if anyone has suffered any injuries, but three families have been displaced by the fire.
Eyewitness Angie Biron works in the area, and says she noticed smoke in the air around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday.
"It started out not that big, but maybe an hour or so later, the smoke was huge," Biron told CTV News Channel.
"The sky was just grey."
Biron said firetrucks began to arrive and emergency responders "started asking people to get out of the street."
